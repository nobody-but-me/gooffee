			    Perhaps I had just become an adult. And I may only remember those
			    nice bands with a bunch of musicians lined up in a straight
			    line, singing and playing their instruments for the children. 
			</p>
			<p>
			    The university has officially started. My new house is still raw, 
			    just like any other recently moved house. Many times I stopped in front
			    of my bedroom window, laid down my ear on it and heard the stuffy car
			    sounds and the annoying motocycles; sometimes, even people could be heard. 
			    They -- the noises -- never stop. At least that's how I feel like.
			</p>
			<p>
			    "Why did the gate to the infity break, Fernando? Non-calculatable 
			    or understandable artistic feelings, could y'all find the signable
			    and/or uncountable static and exact thinking?
			</p>
			<p>
			    "I came home. You were laying down, sleeping. I didn't expect
			    anything different since your nights had become so messy and busy. The
			    blankets barely covered you, leaving half of your body outside,
			    at the non-existent mercy of the winter cold. I knew how easily
			    you could wake up, so I just went to the window and closed its
			    glasses, so the foreign sunshines could still illuminate those
			    wisps of dusts which, even in their dirty essence, became beautiful 
			    sparkles of light below the warm sun of the mornings. The whole bedroom
			    smelled like if it had been stored for years inside children's toys chests, 
			    even counting with that classical lack of important things that, rightly 
			    because of their importance, we forgot completely about them."
			</p>
			<p>
			    It's easier to tell about other's lives than mine. Just like those foreign
			    lights that, without passport or license, joined the bedroom of the couple
			    portrayed in the short story, I am impersonal for my own self. I am the recently
			    moved and raw house, a foreigner who does not know how to speak the language to
			    understand itself. The worse part of it all is that I do not know if there is
			    a passport for the unfamously individual called me.
			</p>
			<p>
			    I already found myself thinking that the beauty and kindness of this 
			    apparently endless world is a beautiful coincidence. The good part
			    of being young is that I feel like I am wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
			    "He held the pen as if he were about to draw on the air infinite lines from a 
			    finite imagination stored somewhere inside that cranial genial box. His stubble
			    beard looked better than in the other days -- perhaps the light coming from the left window 
			    kinda favored his mistreated apparence. The worse part about being inside a classroom in 
			    April is that the professor always found a way to make classes longer. I don't know, he just
			    became inspiring at the highest levels possible, proclaiming difficult words as if in a 
			    greek agora.
			</p>
			<p>
			    "April have always been a bittersweet month. Perhaps because it happens exactly between
			    two very different seasons, or just because this has this kind of energy. People wearing
			    their hoodies and becoming more elegant make things look better, but the brutalist air 
			    and extremely sentimental and perfect rains make this specific month looks.... somehow 
			    displaced. The rain make me remember memories of which I don't even remember being able to 
			    remember them
			</p>
			<p>
			    "The professor sat down. He looked tired -- understandable considering how much he talked. 
			    Suddenly, the white head smiled looking up to the ceiling, as if thinking of someone -- at least, 
			    that's what I want to believe. This kind of faith makes me want to stop being so lonely and 
			    antisocial. Reject such human nature characteristic is, for sure, a mistake. Although I already
			    heard that solitude should've been more well-appreciated... screw this!, I don't care. If love
			    is a mistake, so then I want to commit a mistake again. I bent down so that I could be close
			    enough with the table that I could look at the blackboard while hiding my mouth to the others.
			    So then I allowed myself to laugh."
			</p>
			<p>
			    To be a good young person is to be foolishly stupid. That's what I believe the most.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Today I am going to interview a professor from university. He's a doctor in biology and I want
			    him to talk about the "revival" of the Dire-Wolves. I am going to write an article about them
			    and I want some profissional opinion. My professor allowed me to write this
			    because I told him I am interested on scientific journalism. After the interview, I am likely
			    going to start writing the actual article, since to this moment I still didn't do anything
			    besides researching about the topic. M. told me it's good to know about the topic before writing
			    anything, so I am not feeling very guilty for not having written anything yet.
