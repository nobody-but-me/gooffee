## [09/19/2024][EN] A False (or not) Diary

Hello, my dear reader. Welcome to my diary page.
Here you'll could find a little about my boring
days.

When I was exploring other personal webs and seeing
their amazing blogs, I wanted to creat my own.

To give a little context about the name of this page: at
the beginning, I was thinking of crazy ideas such as write
false stories for this diary and code a whole game for y'all
find out which stories are true or false and then earn points
with it and... Many more other things that no longer have 
sense. I don't know, I just wanted to create different things
but, at the same time, fun, you know?

I'm lazy now and I no longer have energy to do that. Maybe in
the future, who knows. For now, I'm a little tired of this
pathetic struggle of mine for the originality.
